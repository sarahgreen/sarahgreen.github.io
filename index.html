					<h2 id="aboutme">about me</h2>

					<p class="paragraph">Hi there! I'm Sarah, a product manager and human-centered technologist. I am passionate about building systems and tools that improve people's lives. I have experience launching new products in early-stage startups, modernizing and scaling existing products, and coaching software development teams.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">As a consultant at <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://thisisartium.com">Artium</a>, I work with companies of all kinds to connect business goals to development, iteratively define and refine product strategy, and deliver products that create business value while delighting users.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">I was previously a product manager at <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://fluxx.io">Fluxx</a>, a cloud platform for philanthropic grantmaking. I owned multiple core product initiatives, including internationalization and reimagining our approach to third-party integrations. I was a finalist for the Fluxx DNA Award for exemplary performance and embodiment of Fluxx values.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">Prior to Fluxx I worked as a product manager at <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://lifelink.com">LifeLink</a>, an early-stage startup. I focused on creating SMS- and chat-based patient engagement solutions for our healthcare and clinical research customers. I delivered over a dozen distinct products, which accounted for a 750% increase in ARR and growth from 0 to 16,000 monthly active users. I managed the developer backlog and team practices following a modified Extreme Programming (XP) approach. As the eighth employee and sole woman when I joined the team, I championed various initiatives that led to gender parity at the company and improvement in other key DE&I metrics.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">That said, some of my proudest achievements in tech are outside of work. I volunteer with <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://ragtag.org">Ragtag</a>, an organization that mobilizes technologists to support progressive causes. Through Ragtag I've served as the product manager for two web apps in partnership with <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://freefrom.org">FreeFrom</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to economic justice for survivors of domestic violence. Together we built the <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://compass.freefrom.org">Compensation Compass</a>, which provides education on legal paths to compensation in the aftermath of abuse, and the <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://mapandscorecard.freefrom.org">National Survivor Wealth Policy Map</a>, which scores all 50 U.S. states on their domestic violence policies and empowers users to take action. I also volunteer with <a class="bodyLink" target="_blank" href="https://techforcampaigns.org">Tech for Campaigns</a>, which provides tech-based solutions for Democratic candidates for state and local office. I've helped with website design and copywriting as well as SMS-based GOTV initiatives. Finally, I'm a proud member of the Women in Product community and love to mentor people of all backgrounds to pursue a career in product management and tech.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">I graduated from Columbia University with a BA in Computer Science & Business Management. My studies also included a variety of courses in the humanities and social sciences. Throughout my education I explored questions at the intersection of technology, society, and human nature.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I currently reside. In my spare time I enjoy traveling, cooking, practicing yoga, reading, scuba diving, and blind-tasting wine.</p>
